# bAmazon
node.js &amp; MySQL shopping app


bAmazon Overview:

bAmazon is a command line interface app that mimics a shopping app, allowing the user (the customer) to select a product they would like to purchase and then select how many of the products they would like to purchase. Once the customer has selected a product and the quantity desired, the app will first determine if there is enough inventory of that particular item and will then calculate the total cost of the customer's order.

Charles Tuggle made this app. It would have been difficult to impossible to make the app without the tutelage of the staff at George Washington University's Full Stack Web Development Program. Charles would like to offer special thanks to his peers, instructor, and teaching assistants. Thanks!
